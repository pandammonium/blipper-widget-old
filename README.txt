Display your latest blip in a widget.  Requires a Blipfoto account.

== Description ==

Displays the latest entry on Blipfoto by a given user in a widget on your WordPress website.  Note: you must have an account with Blipfoto to use this widget.  If you don't have one, you can [get one for free](https://www.blipfoto.com/account/signu).

Currently, Blipper Widget:

* displays the latest blip (image, title and date) in your Blipfoto account in a widget;
* takes you to the corresponding blip on the Blipfoto website if you click on the image or its title and date (optional);
* displays your journal name and a link to your Blipfoto account (optional); and
* displays a link to the Blipfoto website (optional).

The image in the blip is not stored on your server: the widget links to the image on Blipfoto.

= View the plugin =

If you'd like to see the plugin in action, you can visit [my WordPress site](http://pandammonium.org/) to see Blipper Widget showing my latest blip.

If you'd like to see the plugin code, [it's available on GitHub](https://github.com/pandammonium/blipper-widget).

= Languages =

Currently, only English is supported.  I'm afraid I don't yet know how to make other languages available.  If you'd like to help, let me know in the comments on [my Blipper Plugin page](http://pandammonium.org/wordpress-dev/blipper-widget/).

= About Blipfoto =

[Blipfoto](https://www.blipfoto.com/) is a photo journal service, allowing users to post one photo a day along with descriptive text and tags.  It uses OAuth 2.0 to ensure that your password is kept secure.  You will need to obtain these from Blipfoto.  This is a straightforward process and instructions are given below.

This plugin is independent of and unendorsed by Blipfoto.  Use of this plugin means you consent to this plugin accessing your Blipfoto account and performing actions including publishing your blips on your WordPress website.

= Requirements =

* Blipfoto account
* WordPress 4.3
* PHP 5
* PHP [Client URL (cURL) library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)

= Disclaimer =

By using this plugin, you consent to it performing actions involving your Blipfoto account, including, but not limited to, obtaining your account details (excluding your password).

You, the Blipfoto account holder, are responsible for the images shown on any website using the Blipper Widget with your OAuth credentials and access token.

The Blipfoto PHP SDK is used under [the MIT Licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the widget need my Blipfoto username and password? =

The widget asks for your username for verification purposes, but does not require your password.  It does not ask for your password and it does not have access to your password.  The widget uses an OAuth 2.0 access token to authorise access to your Blipfoto account, eliminating the need for your password.

= Why doesn't the plugin seem to do anything? =
* If you haven't added any blips to your Blipfoto journal, you won't see any blips in your widget.  Please make sure you have at least one blip in your Blipfoto account.
* If you are logged in and are able to change your site's options and settings, you should see an error message indicating the problem.  It is most likely that you have mistyped your username or that you haven't copied your access token correctly.  Amend these details, and try again.
* If you have refreshed your OAuth app credentials or access token at Blipfoto, you will need to update these details on the Blipper Widget settings page.
* You might have hit the rate limit set by Blipfoto.  If this is the case, try again in fifteen minutes or so.

= Where can I get support for Blipper Widget? =

You can use [the Blipper Widget page](http://pandammonium.org/wordpress-dev/wp-blipper-widget/) on my website to ask questions and report problems.

= Is the image stored on my web server? =

No.  The image in the blip is not stored on your server: the widget links to the image on Blipfoto.

= Does the widget use the original image? =

The widget uses the URL of the best quality image made available to it; typically, this is standard resolution.  Standard resolution is normally good enough for display in a widget.

= Can I display the blips from another account with my access token in my widget? =

No.  The access token must belong to the account whose username is given in the widget settings.

Once installed and the OAuth credentials have been set successfully, add the widget to a widget-enabled area, and set up the settings on the widget form as you wish.

* Include link to your latest blip: to link the displayed blip back to the corresponding entry on Blipfoto, tick the box.  The link has a rel="nofollow" attribute.  This option is unticked by default.
* Display journal title and link: to include a link back to your Blipfoto journal, tick the box. For my journal, the link will appear as 'From Panda’s Pics'.  The link has a rel="nofollow" attribute.  This option is unticked by default.
* Include a ‘powered by’ link: to include a 'Powered by Blipfoto' link to be displayed, tick the box.  The link has a rel="nofollow" attribute.  This option is unticked by default.

This plug-in is loosely based on [BlipPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/blippress/) by [Simon Blackbourne](https://mobile.twitter.com/lumpysimon).  I very much appreciate having his work to guide me with the use of [the Blipfoto API](https://www.blipfoto.com/developer/api).

I also used the excellent [Rotating Tweets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rotatingtweets/) plugin to guide me with how to implement the settings page and the widget back-end.

In addition, I used [WP-Spamshield](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-spamshield/) as a model of how to implement uninstallation code.
