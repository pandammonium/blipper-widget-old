Display your latest blip in a widget.  Requires a Polaroid|Blipfoto account.

== Description ==

Displays the latest entry on Polaroid|Blipfoto by a given user in a widget on your WordPress website.  Note: you must have an account with Polaroid|Blipfoto to use this widget.  If you don't have one, you can [get one for free](https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com/account/signup).

Currently, Blipper Widget:

* displays the latest blip (image, title and date) in your Polaroid|Blipfoto account in a widget;
* takes you to the corresponding blip on the Polaroid|Blipfoto website if you click on the image or its title and date (optional);
* displays your journal name and a link to your Polaroid|Blipfoto account (optional); and
* displays a link to the Polaroid|Blipfoto website (optional).

The image in the blip is not stored on your server.  Instead, the widget hotlinks to the image on Polaroid|Blipfoto.

= View the plugin =

If you'd like to see the plugin code, [it's available on GitHub](https://github.com/pandammonium/blipper-widget).

= Languages =
Currently, only English is supported.  I'm afraid I don't yet know how to make other languages available.  If you'd like to help, let me know in the comments on [my Blipper Plugin page](http://pandammonium.org/wordpress-dev/blipper-widget/).

= About Polaroid|Blipfoto =
[Polaroid|Blipfoto](https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com/) is a photo journalling service, allowing users to post one photo a day along with descriptive text and tags.  It uses OAuth 2.0 to ensure that your password is kept secure.  You will need to obtain these from Polaroid|Blipfoto.  This is a straightforward process and instructions are given below.

This plugin is independent of and unendorsed by Polaroid|Blipfoto.

= Requirements =
* Polaroid|Blipfoto account
* WordPress 4.3
* PHP 5
* PHP [Client URL (cURL) library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php)

= Disclaimer =
By using this plugin, you consent to it performing actions involving your Polaroid|Blipfoto account, including, but not limited to, obtaining your account details (excluding your password).

You, the Polaroid|Blipfoto account holder, are responsible for the images shown on any website using the Blipper Widget with your OAuth credentials and access token.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the widget need my Polaroid|Blipfoto username and password? =
The widget uses OAuth 2.0 to authorise access to your Polaroid|Blipfoto account, so there is no need to enter your username or password.  However, the widget is able to access your username through the Polaroid|Blipfoto API.  Since this information is available publicly anyway, this shouldn't be a problem.  If you do have a problem with this, please do not use the widget.

= Why doesn't the plugin seem to do anything? =
* You may not have any blips to view.  Please make sure you have at least one blip in your Polaroid|Blipfoto account.
* It may be because you have made a mistake transferring your OAuth credentials from the Polaroid|Blipfoto website to the plugin settings.  Please make sure these details are correct.
* If you have refreshed your OAuth app credentials or access token at Polaroid|Blipfoto, you will need to update these details on the Blipper Widget settingsd page.

You must be logged in and able to manage WordPress settings to view any error message the plugin produces.

This plug-in is loosely based on BlipPress by [Simon Blackbourne](https://mobile.twitter.com/lumpysimon).  I very much appreciate having his work to guide me with the use of [the Polaroid|Blipfoto API](https://www.polaroidblipfoto.com/developer/api).

I also used the excellent [Rotating Tweets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rotatingtweets/) plugin to guide me with how to implement the settings page and the widget back-end.
